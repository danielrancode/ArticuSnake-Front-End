- Employed Javascript for the floating words, functionality of the game and fetching data.
- Incorporated a Rails backend to store the sentences and to be fetched by the front end.
- Utilized the browser’s Speech Recognition API for user speech input.
- Included an easter egg that fetches photos from the Flickr API if you say: ‘show me [noun]’ during the game.
